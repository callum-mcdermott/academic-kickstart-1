# Jan 14 2020 First Devlog

I'm having some difficulty with setting up the first devlog post. I first tried to get it started on Tuesday but no luck, so I am trying again today (Friday). 
I think I would like to work on the collection from the Nature Museum. I am leaning toward this collection at the moment as it is the furthest away from anything I have worked with before. That being animal bones/remains, rather than documents pertaining to Canadian history, which I think is exciting. After the readings and class discussion this week surrounding the ethics of selling, collecting, and exhibiting human remains I think it would be interesting to study animal bones/remains and see what the similairities and differences are when it comes to the ethical practices of selling, collecting, and exhibiting them in comparison to human remains. However, I wouldn't be surprised if the subject matter is too far out of my comfort zone and I will want to switch to one of the other collections, but I think it will be fun to try it for now and see what it is all about at the museum visit.
