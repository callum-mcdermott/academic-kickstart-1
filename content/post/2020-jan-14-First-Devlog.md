# Jan 14 2020 First Devlog

* I'm having some difficulty with setting up the first devlog post. I first tried to get it started on Tuesday but no luck, so I am trying again today (Friday). 
* I think I would like to work on the collection from the Nature Museum. I am leaning toward this collection at the moment as it is the furthest away from anything I have worked with before. That being animal bones/remains, rather than documents pertaining to Canadian history, which I think is exciting. After the readings and class discussion this week surrounding the ethics of selling, collecting, and exhibiting human remains I think it would be interesting to study animal bones/remains and see what the similairities and differences are when it comes to the ethical practices of selling, collecting, and exhibiting them in comparison to human remains. Is it possible that parts of the collection were looted? Are we able to determine, or has the museum determined the context in which they were found? How did they/we get to these findings? I'm interested to find out! However, I wouldn't be surprised if the subject matter is too far out of my comfort zone and I will want to switch to one of the other collections, but I think it will be fun to try it for now and see what it is all about at the museum visit.
* I found the history museum's [About page](https://www.historymuseum.ca/about/the-corporation/#tabs) which details their mandate as well as their purpose according to the *Museums Act*. This gives us a sense of how the musuem defines itself, and what its purpose is. Making this information public contributes to it being an ethical museum as stated in the Besterman reading
* The [About the Corporation page](https://www.historymuseum.ca/about/the-corporation/#tabs) under the 'Doing Business With Us' tab outlines some of the ways in which the museum purchases objects for its collection/exhibit, it sounded like a lot of legal jargon to me but it's there! 
* It terms of the'data' available on their site their [Resource Centre](https://www.historymuseum.ca/learn/resource-centre/) seems to be where the data for individual objects is, so it was pretty easy to find but i'm not sure how it could be downloaded
* Errors encountered this week:
  * Not being able to see this post right off the bat on my netlify site (.md was the answer!)
  * Had an issue with Tropy, I thought I was able to download it successfully but when I go to open it it says that the application has crashed so not sure how to get around that, I may try to uninstall and install again
